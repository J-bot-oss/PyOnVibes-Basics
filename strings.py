# A string is a series of characters enclosed in quotes.
# It can either be single quoted or double quoted.

# for example:
greeting = 'Hello, World!' # This is a string value stored ina variable called greeting
greeting_double = "Hello, World!" # This is also a string value stored in a variable called greeting_double

# The quotes also allow for flexibility in how we can define strings.
# We can use both single quotes and double quotes.

# For example:
message = 'She said "Hello!"' # This string has double quotes inside single quotes.
message_double = "The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python." # This string has single quotes inside double quotes

# We can also use triple quotes for multi-line strings.
multi_line_message = """This is a multi-line string""" # or
multi_line_message_triple = '''This is  also a multi-line string''' # both are valid

# To print the values of the strings initialized above, we use the print function:
print(greeting) # output: Hello, World!
print(greeting_double) # ouput: Hello, World!
print(message) # Output: She said "Hello!"
print(message_double) # Output: The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python.
print(multi_line_message) # Output: This is a multi-line string.
print(multi_line_message_triple) # Output: This is also a multi-line string.
